TODO: contribute a defmethod example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defmethod equalp ((p1 point) (p2 point))
   (â€¦))
#+END_SRC

* Libraries
** cl-annot: Python-like annotations

 https://github.com/m2ym/cl-annot

 Without the slime helper, can't use it in the REPL ??

 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 If you  use Emacs,  it is  recommended to  install misc/slime-annot.el
 which  contains   some  features   of  annotations.    After  locating
 misc/slime-annot.el into your loadpath,  write the following code into
 your .emacs.
 #+END_QUOTE

 : (require 'slime-annot)

** trivial-arguments

 https://github.com/Shinmera/trivial-arguments

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (defun foo (a b c &optional d) nil)
 (arglist #'foo)
 ;; (a b c &optional d)
 #+END_SRC

* Rules

- don't install libraries that need a Slime helper to work in the REPL (cl-annot).
