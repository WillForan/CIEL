## IF-LET 

ARGLIST: `(bindings &body (then-form &optional else-form))`

FUNCTION: Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes either
THEN-FORM or ELSE-FORM. ELSE-FORM defaults to NIL.

BINDINGS must be either single binding of the form:

 (variable initial-form)

or a list of bindings of the form:

 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))

All initial-forms are executed sequentially in the specified order. Then all
the variables are bound to the corresponding values.

If all variables were bound to true values, the THEN-FORM is executed with the
bindings in effect, otherwise the ELSE-FORM is executed with the bindings in
effect.

## WHEN-LET 

ARGLIST: `(bindings &body forms)`

FUNCTION: Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes FORMS.

BINDINGS must be either single binding of the form:

 (variable initial-form)

or a list of bindings of the form:

 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))

All initial-forms are executed sequentially in the specified order. Then all
the variables are bound to the corresponding values.

If all variables were bound to true values, then FORMS are executed as an
implicit PROGN.

## WHEN-LET* 

ARGLIST: `(bindings &body body)`

FUNCTION: Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes BODY.

BINDINGS must be either single binding of the form:

 (variable initial-form)

or a list of bindings of the form:

 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))

Each INITIAL-FORM is executed in turn, and the variable bound to the
corresponding value. INITIAL-FORM expressions can refer to variables
previously bound by the WHEN-LET*.

Execution of WHEN-LET* stops immediately if any INITIAL-FORM evaluates to NIL.
If all INITIAL-FORMs evaluate to true, then BODY is executed as an implicit
PROGN.
