I got hooked into Lisp circa 2017. I contributed massively to the
Common Lisp Coobook, the Awesome-CL list, and eventually wrote my own
libraries and software. I did my first contracting job in Lisp in
2019, and I am now running an open-source web application for
bookshops in productionÂ©. For more: [[https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/about/][about]].
